    "Combinatorial formulas are of great use in calculating probabilities. We will present the most important of these formulas.\n",

    "**Theorem 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $N_1$ elements of some type and $N_2$ elements of some other type. Then there can be $N_1N_2$  distinct ordered pairs containing\n",
    "one element of each type.\n",

    "#### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "For example lets' say we have 5 shirts and 6 neck ties. How many distinct pairs can we have? Using the theorem above this is 30 pairs.\n",
    "We can in fact generalize **Theorem 1** this is addressed below\n",

    "\n",
    "Given $r$ distinct types and each for the first type we  $N_1$ elements for the second type $N_2$ and so on up to the $r$th type \n",

    "Sampling with replacement is a commonly used sampling tactic is data science. Let's assume we have a population with $N$ objects. Each time\n",
    "we sample from the population an object and then return it back. We sample in total $r$ objects. \n",
    "How many distinct samples can we form? According to **Theorem 2** there can be in total $N^r$ distinct samples. \n",
    "We can derive this by treating each object drawn from the population as a distinct type. So the sample will be an ordered tuple of the form [1]:\n",

    "\n",
    "Each type $a_{i_j}$ can be selected from $N$ elements, since we sample with replacement, so according to **Theorem 2**\n",

    "\n",
    " \n",
    "**Theorem 2** can also be used to derive the number of permutations of $N$ objects. We know that this $N!$. This is infact the number of distinct samples\n",
