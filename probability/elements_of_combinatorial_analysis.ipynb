    "## Combinatorial analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinatorial formulas are of great use in calculating probabilities. We will present the most important of these formulas.\n",
    "You can find a more detailed discussion about these formulas in [1]\n",

    "**Theorem 1 (Multiplication Principle)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $N_1$ elements of some type and $N_2$ elements of some other type. Then there can be: \n",
    "$$N_1N_2$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "in total distinct ordered pairs containing one element of each type.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example lets' say we have 5 shirts and 6 neck ties. How many distinct pairs can we have? Using the theorem above this is 30 pairs.\n",
    "We can in fact generalize **Theorem 1**. This is addressed below\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "**Theorem 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $r$ distinct types and each for the first type we  $N_1$ elements for the second type $N_2$ and so on up to the $r$th type \n",
    "that we have $N_r$ elements. Then there can be $N_1\\times N_2\\times \\dots \\times N_r$ distinct ordered tuples containing\n",
    "one element of each type.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2\n",
    "For example, taken from [1], lets assume we have three dice. How many different outcomes can we have? Using **Theorem 2** this is $6^3=216$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3\n",
    "Sampling with replacement is a commonly used sampling tactic is data science. Let's assume we have a population with $N$ objects. Each time\n",
    "we sample from the population an object and then return it back. We sample in total $r$ objects. \n",
    "How many distinct samples can we form? According to **Theorem 2** there can be in total $N^r$ distinct samples. \n",
    "We can derive this by treating each object drawn from the population as a distinct type. So the sample will be an ordered tuple of the form [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "(a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\dots a_{i_r})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Each type $a_{i_j}$ can be selected from $N$ elements, since we sample with replacement, so according to **Theorem 2**\n",
    "we will have in total $N^r$ distinct samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. As such, the order of the objects is important when we want to count the orderings we can achieve. Let's assume that we have a set with $N$ elements.  We are intersted in knowing how many different ways\n",
    "we can permute these items in groups having size $r$. This depends on whether we sample with replacement or not [1,2].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sampling with replacement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume first that we sampel with replacememt. Then the each choice of the $r$ items can be chosen in $n$ different ways.\n",
    "Hence, we have [1,2\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n \\times n \\times n \\times \\dots \\times n = n^r$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sampling without replacement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling without replacement means that once an element is out from the set, then this element is not available any more.\n",
    "Therefore, we have \n",
    "\n",
    "$$n \\times (n -1) \\times (n-2) \\times \\dots \\times (n - r + 1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{r}^{N} = \\frac{N!}{(N-r)!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Theorems 1 and 2 deal with the case of having distinct types or items and how to cobine them. Now let's look at the case where\n",
    "**we cannot distinguish** these items and assume that collectively we have $N$ items.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, suppose we are a given a set $A$ containing $n$ objects. Suppose we choose $r$ elements out of this set and list the\n",
    "selected objects in the order they were drawn. We ask how many different ways can we do this. This depends on how we samples the \n",
    "items out of the set [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 4**\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of arrangements of 3 colors taken from 5 colors is \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{3}^{5} = \\frac{5!}{2!}$$\n",
    " \n",
    "**Theorem 2** can also be used to derive the number of permutations of $N$ objects. We know that this $N!$. This is infact the number of distinct samples\n",
    "we can get when sampling without replacement.\n",
