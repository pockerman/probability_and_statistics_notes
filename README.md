# Applied Mathematics Notes

This is a series of notes about the very broad subject of
applied mathematics. The notes are organised into 
jupyter notebooks.

As the name suggests these are just notes, so many topics will lack the
rigorousness that a formal treatment of the subject would deliver.


## Creating a book

You can create a book from the notes using <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>. 
You can preview the book by using 

```
quarto preview

```

on the top level directory of the project

## Requirements

The notes depend on a set of requirements. Use

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

to install what is needed.
