    "RSM is similar to A/B testing in the sense that it also involves the three stages we discussed when looking A/B testing namely; design, measure and analyze. However, the methods differ in how the analysis stage is carried out. In RSM, we generally, build a model, e.g. linear regression, that interpolates between measurements. We then optimze over that model to find good estimates of the optimal parameters settings. Therefore, RSM also involves an extra step; the validation stage."
