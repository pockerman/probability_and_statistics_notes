    "Creating a view in Spark has a similar syntax to creating a table. The difference between a table and a view\n",
    "is that a view does not actually hold any data [1]. Once a view is created, we cab query just like we\n",
    "can query a table. Creating a view of a table is simple. This is shown below\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that when using a a global temporary view we must use the prefix ```gloabl_temp.<your-view-name>```. This is\n",
