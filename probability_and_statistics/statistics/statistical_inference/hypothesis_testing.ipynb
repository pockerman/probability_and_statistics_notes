It serves the idea of nothing special occurs. In other words, is always an equality or absence of an effect or relation [2]. In order to reject the null hypothesis, we need significant evidence which is provided  by the data [2] . Only when such evidence is found, and when it strongly supports the alternative $H_a$ , can the hypothesis $H_0$ be rejected in favor of $H_a$."
