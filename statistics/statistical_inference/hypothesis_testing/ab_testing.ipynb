    "- **Take measurements stage**: In this stage we measure the metrics we agreed upon in the previous stage. Notice however that we need to be careful and measure only the effect of switching from version A to version B. This can be done by using randomizaton. Randomization is essential in order to inadvertently include the impact of other factors that affect may affect the  business metric; e.g. time of day, user demographics, location of a data center e.t.c.\n",
