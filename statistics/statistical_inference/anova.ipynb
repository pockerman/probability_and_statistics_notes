    "One-way ANOVA is a methodology for  comparing whether two samples' means are significantly different. This is typically done the $F-$distribution. It is called one-way as it requires a numeric response variable $Y$ and one explanatory variable $X$ [1]. The methodology\n",

    " To do this, two estimates are made of the population variance. These estimates rely on various assumptions (see below). The ANOVA produces an F-statistic, the ratio of the variance calculated among the means to the variance within the samples. If the group means are drawn from populations with the same mean values, the variance between the group means should be lower than the variance of the samples, following the central limit theorem. A higher ratio therefore implies that the samples were drawn from populations with different mean values.[1]\n",

    "The ANOVA tests the null hypothesis, which states that samples in all groups are drawn from populations with the same mean values."
