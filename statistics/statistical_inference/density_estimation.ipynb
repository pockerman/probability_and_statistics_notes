    "In this section review the concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_estimation\">density estimation</a>. Density estimation is the construction of an estimate, based on observed data, of an unobservable underlying probability density function. The unobservable density function is thought of as the density according to which a large population is distributed; the data are usually thought of as a random sample from that population [1]. \n",
