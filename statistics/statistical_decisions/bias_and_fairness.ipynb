    "In general, a model—or really, any predictive or decision-making process—can suffer from two forms of bias: disparate treatment and disparate impact. A model is considered to suffer from disparate treatment if predictions are in some way based on a sensitive attribute (e.g., sex or race). A model could also have a disparate impact if the predictions or downstream outcomes of the predictions disproportionately hurt or benefit people with specific sensitive features, which can look like predicting higher rates of recidivism for one race over another."
